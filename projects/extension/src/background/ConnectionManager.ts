/**
 * # Overview
 *
 * This class primarily contains two lists:
 *
 * - A list of sandboxes. Each sandbox contains a list of chain connections. A chain within a
 * sandbox cannot interact in any way with a chain of a different sandbox. Pragmatically speaking,
 * a sandbox corresponds to a browser tab, however what a sandbox corresponds to is out of concern
 * of this module. You can add and remove sandboxes using {ConnectionManager.addSandbox} and
 * {ConnectionManager.deleteSandbox}.
 *
 * - A list of "well-known" chains specifications. Well-known chain specifications are passed to
 * the constructor and cannot be modified afterwards.
 *
 * # Sandboxes usage
 *
 * A sandbox can be added using {ConnectionManager.addSandbox}. Each sandbox is identified by a
 * `SandboxId`, which is a generic argument of the {ConnectionManager}. This `SandboxId` must be
 * provided every time you want to call a method that relates to a specific sandbox. Once a sandbox
 * has been removed (using {ConnectionManager.deleteSandbox}), the {ConnectionManager} instantly
 * removes all traces of this sandbox. Calling a method (other than {ConnectionManager.addSandbox})
 * with an unknown `SandboxId` leads to an exception being thrown.
 *
 * Once a sandbox has been added using {ConnectionManager.addSandbox}, you can inject messages
 * that concern this sandbox using {ConnectionManager.sandboxMessage}. These messages must conform
 * to the {ToExtension} interface and to the protocol described in the
 * `@substrate/connect-extension-protocol` package.
 *
 * A sandbox will spontaneously generate messages that conform to the {ToApplication} interface of
 * the `@substrate/connect-extension-protocol` package. Use the
 * {ConnectionManager.nextSandboxMessage} function to retrieve these messages as they are
 * generated.
 *
 * # Information about the list of chains
 *
 * At any point, information about all the chains contained within the {ConnectionManager} can
 * be retrieved using {ConnectionManager.allChains}. This can be used for display purposes.
 *
 * # Database
 *
 * In addition to {@link ToExtension} messages, one can also inject {@link ToConnectionManager}
 * messages.
 *
 * This can be used to retrieve the content of the so-called "database" of a chain.
 * The string sent back in the {@link ToOutsideDatabaseContent} is opaque and shouldn't be
 * interpreted in any way by the API user.
 *
 * The {@link ToConnectionManagerAddWellKnownChain} accepts a `databaseContent` field that can
 * be used to pass the "database" that was grabbed the last time the chain was running.
 *
