# Substrate Connect Applications

Demo applications using the [Substrate Connect tool set](../packages).

## Burner Wallet

A light-client-based, in-browser wallet for Substrate. It's meant to be quick and easy to use but less secure than other solutions.

## Smoldot Extension (name in progress)

A smoldot-based, browser extension that allows browser apps to connect and interact with nodes - through smoldot - only by the use of the extension.
