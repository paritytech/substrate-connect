# @substrate/connect-extension-protocol

This is a module consisting (almost) only of types. These types are the types
of the messages exchanged between apps using `@substrate/connect` and the
browser extension. This package is shared between `@substrate/connect` and the
extension in order for the TypeScript compiler to enforce the contract between
them.
