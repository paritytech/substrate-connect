# tx-helper

This is a copy and paste of the [Polkadot API Client Tx directory](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/tree/df5c969a1c73fa381aaf71f72e8c52e64c788b36/packages/client/src/tx). We use this in substrate connect to create transactions.

These are considered internal to polkadot API which is why we need to copy and paste.
